# Choons
Choons is an electron-based music player like iTunes, but mostly designed for [![CoverFlowOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CoverFlowOS-blue?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/DrawDrimer/CoverflowOS)

## Compiling
It's very easy, run `npm install` and then run `electron .`, if that doesn't work try using `npm run start` instead of `electron .`
